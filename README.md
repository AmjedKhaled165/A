### 1. Quality Management Plan (QMP)
Test Case: Establish a comprehensive QMP for the project.

Plan: Define roles and responsibilities for quality assurance, outline processes for risk management, and detail procedures for monitoring and evaluating system performance to ensure adherence to quality standards.

### 1. Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures
**Test Case:** Ensure that the camera system meets the quality standards for image clarity and reliability.
- **Procedure:** Regularly schedule system checks and audits of camera feeds to verify image resolution and functionality. Ensure compliance with standards for classroom environments.

### 2. Test Plans and Test Cases
**Test Case:** Evaluate the accuracy of the cheating detection algorithm.
- **Plan:** Develop scenarios where cheating could occur (e.g., students looking at unauthorized materials). Assess how accurately the system identifies these scenarios and captures images.

### 3. Defect Reports
**Test Case:** Identify and report issues with image capture or system response times.
- **Report:** If a camera fails to capture an incident or sends a delayed notification to administration, log the defect with detailed descriptions, timestamps, and potential impacts.

### 4. Change Requests
**Test Case:** Request enhancements to the system based on user feedback.
- **Request:** If users find the current notification system cumbersome, propose changes to improve the user interface for the administration dashboard.

### 5. Version Control System (VCS) Logs
**Test Case:** Track changes made to the software that processes and analyzes the camera feeds.
- **Log:** Maintain a detailed history of updates to the cheating detection algorithm, including date, description of changes, and associated test results.

### 6. Release Notes
**Test Case:** Document updates made during system upgrades.
- **Notes:** After an update that improves image processing speed, include a summary of the enhancements and any new features added to the monitoring system.

### 7. Configuration Management (CM) Documentation
**Test Case:** Ensure proper configuration of cameras and software across all classrooms.
- **Documentation:** Maintain records of camera placements, configurations, and any software settings to facilitate troubleshooting and maintenance.

### 8. Quality Metrics and Reports
**Test Case:** Measure the effectiveness of the cheating detection system.
- **Metrics:** Collect data on the number of cheating incidents detected vs. false positives/negatives. Generate reports that analyze trends over time and suggest improvements.

### 9. Training Materials and Records
**Test Case:** Develop training for staff on using the monitoring system effectively.
- **Materials:** Create user manuals and training sessions to educate school administration on interpreting notifications and taking appropriate actions when cheating is detected.
