### 1. Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures
**Test Case:** Ensure that the camera system meets the quality standards for image clarity and reliability.
- **Procedure:** Regularly schedule system checks and audits of camera feeds to verify image resolution and functionality. Ensure compliance with standards for classroom environments.

### 2. Test Plans and Test Cases
**Test Case:** Evaluate the accuracy of the cheating detection algorithm.
- **Plan:** Develop scenarios where cheating could occur (e.g., students looking at unauthorized materials). Assess how accurately the system identifies these scenarios and captures images.

### 3. Defect Reports
**Test Case:** Identify and report issues with image capture or system response times.
- **Report:** If a camera fails to capture an incident or sends a delayed notification to administration, log the defect with detailed descriptions, timestamps, and potential impacts.

### 4. Change Requests
**Test Case:** Request enhancements to the system based on user feedback.
- **Request:** If users find the current notification system cumbersome, propose changes to improve the user interface for the administration dashboard.

### 5. Version Control System (VCS) Logs
**Test Case:** Track changes made to the software that processes and analyzes the camera feeds.
- **Log:** Maintain a detailed history of updates to the cheating detection algorithm, including date, description of changes, and associated test results.

### 6. Release Notes
**Test Case:** Document updates made during system upgrades.
- **Notes:** After an update that improves image processing speed, include a summary of the enhancements and any new features added to the monitoring system.

### 7. Configuration Management (CM) Documentation
**Test Case:** Ensure proper configuration of cameras and software across all classrooms.
- **Documentation:** Maintain records of camera placements, configurations, and any software settings to facilitate troubleshooting and maintenance.

### 8. Quality Metrics and Reports
**Test Case:** Measure the effectiveness of the cheating detection system.
- **Metrics:** Collect data on the number of cheating incidents detected vs. false positives/negatives. Generate reports that analyze trends over time and suggest improvements.

### 9. Training Materials and Records
**Test Case:** Develop training for staff on using the monitoring system effectively.
- **Materials:** Create user manuals and training sessions to educate school administration on interpreting notifications and taking appropriate actions when cheating is detected.

### 10. Feedback and Continuous Improvement
**Test Case:** Gather feedback from teachers and administrators on the system’s performance.
- **Process:** Implement regular surveys or meetings to discuss the system’s effectiveness, gather suggestions, and prioritize areas for improvement based on user experiences.

By applying these test cases to your project, you can ensure a robust framework for quality management that enhances the system's reliability and effectiveness in monitoring academic integrity.
